# Product Context

## Purpose
This project is an email generation system that appears to be in its initial setup phase. It consists of a frontend and backend architecture, designed to facilitate email content generation.

## Problems it Solves
- Automates the process of email content generation
- Provides a structured approach to email template management
- Offers a user interface for email content creation and management

## How it Should Work
The system should:
1. Allow users to create and manage email templates
2. Generate customized email content based on user inputs
3. Provide a frontend interface for easy interaction
4. Have a backend service to handle the email generation logic

## Current State
- Project structure is initialized with frontend and backend directories
- Dependencies are set up in package.json including:
  - @inquirer/prompts: For interactive CLI prompts
  - axios: For HTTP requests
  - dotenv: For environment variable management
  - minimatch: For file pattern matching
- Node modules are currently deleted and need to be reinstalled
- Both frontend and backend directories are empty and need implementation
